# SuperHero Network: MostPopularSuperhero.scala

Here we want to track the connections between super heroes analysing data in comic books. 

Someone actually went out and looked at every single Marvel comic book and kept track of all the superheroes that appear together within the same comic book. And what we're doing is we're treating those co appearances within comic books as social connections. So the fact that for example the Hulk and  Spider-Man appeared in the same comic might imply that they're friends if you will.

Suppose one example where the Hulk appeared with Iron Man and The Hulk appeared with Thor but Thor only appeared with Iron Man.
And you know how they were different comic books and maybe Spider-Man and The Hulk are connected by appearing in the same comic book, but let's pretend that Spider-Man and Thor never actually appeared in the same comic book totally made up social graph here. But it gives you a very simple example of what a social graph looks like and just like we can construct something like this in the context of superheroes who appeared with each other in the same comic books.

For this example we will work with two files that come with the state. So we're gonna work with what is called Marvel-graphs.txt, which contains the actual social graph itself in kind of a strange format. And then there's Marvel-names.txt, which just maps superhero IDs to their human readable names.

      5304 "SPHINX II"
      5305 "SPHINX III"
      5306 "SPIDER-MAN/PETER PAR"
      5307 "SPIDER-MAN III/MARTH"
      5308 "SPIDER-MAN CLONE/BEN"
      5309 "SPIDER-WOMAN/JESSICA"

The Marvel-graphs.txt every line is just this big stream of numbers. And the way to interpret it is the _first number_ represents a given superhero and all the subsequent numbers represents all of the superheroes that appeared with that superhero in other comic books.
We know that's the hero that we're talking about and it's followed by a list of all the heroes that appeared with that Hero.

And to map those hero IDs to names we can do that with the Marvel-names.txt. So, for example you can see that Spider-Man is 5306. And actually he appears with whoever 399 as in this example Spider-Man is pretty popular. But let's find out if he's actually the most popular.

In this first approach we need to see who is the most popular among the super heroes. For that we are define a strategy:

- Map input data (heroID, number of co-occurences) per line

- add up co.occurence by heroId using reduceByKey()

- Flip (map) RDD to (number, heroID) 

- Use max() on the RDD to find the hero with the most co-occurrences

- Look up the name of the winner and display the result

Our high level strategy will be to parsing that input line one line at a time. And since we don't really care about the actual individual connections for this problem we just want find out who's the most popular.

All we care about is the total number of connections for each superhero. So we're going to look at each line of input data extract the superhero ID that's the first number though that we're talking about. And then just store the count the total number of other superheroes that appear with that super hero.

Now remember these can span multiple lines so the same superhero idea might be broken up onto two or more of different lines so we need to combine them together somehow and **reduceByKey** will allow us to add up all the individual lines for a given superhero into one final result. From there we use the same sorting trick that we've used before. We're just going to flip that around so that the key is the count of how many friends you have and the value becomes the superhero ID.

And then we can just call Max on the resulting RDD to find who has the most friends and friends again it's a proxy for coappearances in other comic books in this example. Then we can look up the name of the winner from Marvel-names.txt and display the result.

If we click on the **marvel-graph.txt** and preview them you'll see that they are as I advertised Marvel graph again just
a list of lines that have a bunch of numbers on them where each number represents a superhero ID.
The first number is the hero we're talking about followed by a list of that hero's connections. We have **marvel-names.txt** which is mapping super hero IDs to their human readable names, where the names are enclosed in quotation marks.


**Build up an RDD** that can map superhero IDs to superhero names. We can also build up an RDD and that will be automatically be available to every node near the cluster as well.

So to do this we're going to call **flatMap** on the parseNames with the parseNames function that we defined. Remember in the marvel-names.txt each row is a number and a space and then within quotation marks the name of that character. But there is some invalidated data in here somewhere maybe there are some empty names maybe there is some blank lines. So we need to deal with all these different edge cases as well. And that's where a flat map comes in. So if there's a possibility of a line that we cannot successfully parse we only use something like a flat map so we have the option of returning nothing for a given line because it's not actually going to end up in our RDD. **So that's where we're calling flat map instead of map.**

    // Build up a hero ID -> name RDD
    val names = sc.textFile("../marvel-names.txt")
    val namesRdd = names.flatMap(parseNames)

**parseNames function**

    // Function to extract hero ID -> hero name tuples (or None in case of failure)
      def parseNames(line: String) : Option[(Int, String)] = {
        var fields = line.split('\"')
        if (fields.length > 1) {
           return Some(fields(0).trim().toInt, fields(1))
        } else {
          return None // flatmap will just discard None results, and extract data from Some results.
      }
    }

The input is a string of the Marvel names that textfile and the output is going to be an **option a scala, option of a tuple** of a superhero ID and the superhero name. Basically an option is a scala construct for saying you could have data where you might not have data in other languages. We have the concept of a null value or a nil value or something of that nature scala doesn't have that. Instead it has the concept of an option that wraps basically a value and you can have either an actual value returned as an option and that is a sum value which is a subclass of option or you can return a non-value which is also a subclass of option.
So by returning an option you can return a sum which actually contains data or none which contains no data.

And when you're using **flatMap** what will happen is that if you return a sum object it will say OK. We are gonna actually construct a line in the new RDD based on what's inside that some object but if it returns _None_ it will say _OK_ there's nothing actually to do here. I'm not going to create a new line at all in my resulting RDD.

In resume: With this Option we can guarantee that each line of an RDD has data with the format that we defined in the function parseNames.

This is the result from flatMap with parseNames function:

      (18558,MARVEL MYSTERY COMIC)
      (18559,HUMAN TORCH 4)
      
**For counting the superheroes** that are in a just line we defined a countCoOccurrences function. It is split the elements of each line with white spaces. The regular expression "w+" is for one white space. But the "s+" is a regular expression that means split
it up based on whitespace. Whenever white spaces might be multiple spaces and might be tabs that might be tabs and spaces. We don't care just split up on whitespace please. The output of this function is the first number (superhero ID) and the amount of element that the line contains minus one. Because the first one id the superhero ID.

    // Function to extract the hero ID and number of connections from each line
    def countCoOccurences(line: String) = {
      var elements = line.split("\\s+")
      ( elements(0).toInt, elements.length - 1 )
    }
    
Here we read the marvel-hraph.txt and map each line to extract the information that was defined on _countCoOccurences_ function.

    // Load up the superhero co-apperarance data
    val lines = sc.textFile("../marvel-graph.txt")
    
    // Convert to (heroID, number of connections) RDD
    val pairings = lines.map(countCoOccurences)

Next we use _reduceByKey_ to have (heroId, connections)

    // Combine entries that span more than one line
    val totalFriendsByCharacter = pairings.reduceByKey( (x,y) => x + y )

And here we flip the information (connections, heroID)

    // Flip it to # of connections, heroID
    val flipped = totalFriendsByCharacter.map( x => (x._2, x._1) )

Here we find the hero with most of connections:

     // Find the max # of connections
    val mostPopular = flipped.max()

The result is:

      (1933,859)   //connections, heroID

And here we extract the name of this superheroe using **lookup** between _namesRdd_ and _mostPopular_.

    // Look up the name (lookup returns an array of results, so we need to access the first result with (0)).
    val mostPopularName = namesRdd.lookup(mostPopular._2)(0)
    
    // Print out our answer!
    println(s"$mostPopularName is the most popular superhero with ${mostPopular._1} co-appearances.")
     
The result is:
    
    CAPTAIN AMERICA is the most popular superhero with 1933 co-appearances.
    
    
As exercise is purposed print out the Top 10 super heroes:

     //Top 10
    val sortedheroes = flipped.sortByKey(false)               //connection , heroID, descending order
    val herotop = sortedheroes.take(10)                       // taking the 10 first
    val mostTenPopularConID = herotop.map( x => (x._1,x._2))  //connection , heroID
    
    println()    
    println("Top 10")
    //print out
    for ( x <- mostTenPopularConID) {
      val mostPopularName2 = namesRdd.lookup(x._2)(0)
      val connect = x._1
      println(s"$mostPopularName2 has $connect co-appearances.") 
    }
   

# SupeHero Network: Breadth First Search algorithm


The main objective is find the degrees of separation between any two superheroes.
And to do that we're going to introduce a concept called **breadth first search** which is a _computer science algorithm_ and illustrate how you can use Apache Spark to implement what might not seem at first to be something that lends itself to distributed processing but through some creative thinking you can take even complex algorithms like this and make a spark application out of them.


So maybe you've heard the story that the actor Kevin Bacon is six degrees away from any other actor in Hollywood.
That is if you look at the people that Kevin Bacon has appeared with in other films and the people that those people appeared with in other films and so on and so forth. Everyone's within six degrees of Kevin Bacon.

The same is true of the superheroes in our superhero social network.
You might be surprised at just how closely everyone is connected to say Superman and to get a little feeling of what I mean by Degrees of Separation.

So in this example the Hulk and Spider-Man are one degrees of separation apart from each other because they have a direct connection.
But for example Iron Man is **two degrees of separation** from Spider-Man because we have to go through the Hulk to find Iron Man.


So for example to make it more concrete even the Hulk in Spider-Man may have appeared in the same comic book. But let's say that Spider-Man and Iron Man never did, but Iron Man and The Hulk did.Therefore they're two degrees of separation apart. 

Take Thor for example. If you take this path we might say that he has three degrees of separation but we always talk about the shortest path So and in the case of Thor he would be two degrees of separation because they are connected by one person the Hulk. OK two steps to get to Thor.


So how do we do that. Well we need to use a _search algorithm_ called **breadth first search**.

So what we have here is basically a network graph in computer science terms. So imagine every one of these circles represents a super hero in our social graph and these lines represent the connections between them, you know the people that appear together in the same comic books and this example. -> 00:02:14.250
