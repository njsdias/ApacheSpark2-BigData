## Learning the basics

Here we are working with LearningScala1.sc to LearningScala4.sc files that you can be founded in [ScalaSpark folder](https://github.com/njsdias/ApacheSpark2-BigData/tree/master/SparkScala).

So, here is only to write important notes.

  - 1- The same code in scala-spark run most faster than in python-spark
  
  - 2- In Scala is high recommeded use IMMUTABLE variables (those which don't have values changed along the code)
  
    - IMMUTABLE -> val namevariable = x
    
    - MUTABLE -> var namevariable = x
    
   You can specify the type of the variable, but the scala is able to didentify it for you:
   
    var namevaribale: String = "Hello"
